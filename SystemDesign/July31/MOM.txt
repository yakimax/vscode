-> Object -> toString, equals, hashcode
-> Integer vs int, Integer[] vs int[]

-> Design Patterns
    -> Singleton
    -> Observor
    -> Adaptor
    -> Decorator

-> Lambda functions
-> Access Modifiers
----------------------------------------------

1. Base class of all classes in Java is Object
2. Why does ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap etc. print their content in syso and our class doesnot do it?
    -> Because these classes override the toString function of Object class
