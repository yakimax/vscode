Notes
    Adapter
    -> There is an already existing data provider which provides data in format1
    -> There is an already existing data consumer which expects data in format2
    -> format1 != format2
    -> We have to write an adapter which converts between the two formats
    -> Consumer will call the adapter
    -> Adapter will call the provider and get data in format1
    -> Adapter will convert data from format1 to format2
    -> Consumer will get data in format2 from the adapter
    -> Real life usage
        -> Let us say we want weather API data and we found a weather API
        -> Our code is expecting data in JSON format
        -> Weather API is returning data in XML format
        -> We will have to write an adapter on the API. The Adapter will call API and get data in XML format and convert it to JSON for use by our code.
