Static Data Members
    Meaning?
    Implication?
    Warning?
Static Function?
    Meaning? -> Doesn't require objects for their invocation, can be called directly via class names
    Where are they used?
        Utility stateless fns example Math.min, Math.max, Arrays.sort, Arrays.fill
        Stateless -> Nothing is saved between two fn calls, each call is independent and takes
        all input as parameters
    Implications?
        this keyword cannot be used in static fns. Why?
            (because can be called by class name, in that case "this" won't know which instance to point to)
        non-static data members can't be  used in static fns. Why?
            (because it can be called by classname and in that case we don't if any object exists, and if they do, we won't know which objects non-static data members to use.)
        non-static fns can't be used in static fns. Why?
            -> can be used, by making an object inside the static fn and calling the non-static fn on it
            -> can't be called directly

    Can non-static fn, use static data member? Why? -> Yes, because we have extra information available (not less)
    Can non-static fn, use static fn? Why? -> same as above.
